    Computer name, label name, or any other label expression like <code>linux &amp;&amp; 64bit</code> to restrict where this step builds.
    May be left blank, in which case any available executor is taken.

  <h3>Supported operators</h3>
  The following operators are supported, in descending order of precedence:
  <dl>
    <dt><tt>(expression)</tt></dt>
    <dd>
      parentheses — used to explicitly define the associativity of an expression
    </dd>

    <dt><tt>!expression</tt></dt>
    <dd>
      NOT — negation; the result of <tt>expression</tt> must <b>not</b> be true
    </dd>

    <dt><tt>a &amp;&amp; b</tt></dt>
    <dd>
      AND — <b>both</b> of the expressions <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt> must be
      true
    </dd>

    <dt><tt>a || b</tt></dt>
    <dd>
      OR — <b>either</b> of the expressions <tt>a</tt> or <tt>b</tt> may be
      true
    </dd>

    <dt><tt>a -> b</tt></dt>
    <dd>
      "implies" operator — equivalent to <tt>!a || b</tt>.<br>
      For example, <tt>windows -> x64</tt> could be thought of as "if a Windows
      agent is used, then that agent <i>must</i> be 64-bit", while still
      allowing this block to be executed on any agents that <i>do not</i> have
      the <tt>windows</tt> label, regardless of whether they have also have an
      <tt>x64</tt> label
    </dd>

    <dt><tt>a &lt;-> b</tt></dt>
    <dd>
      "if and only if" operator — equivalent to <tt>a &amp;&amp; b ||
      !a &amp;&amp; !b</tt><br>
      For example, <tt>windows &lt;-> dc2</tt> could be thought of as "if a
      Windows agent is used, then that agent <i>must</i> be in datacenter 2, but
      if a non-Windows agent is used, then it <i>must not</i> be in datacenter
      2"
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <h3>Notes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      All operators are left-associative, i.e. <tt>a -> b -> c</tt> is
      equivalent to <tt>(a -> b) -> c</tt>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Labels or agent names can be surrounded with quotation marks if they
      contain characters that would conflict with the operator syntax.<br>
      For example, <tt>"osx (10.11)" || "Windows Server"</tt>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Expressions can be written without whitespace, but including it is
      recommended for readability; Jenkins will ignore whitespace when
      evaluating expressions.
    </li>
    <li>
      Matching labels or agent names with wildcards or regular expressions is
      not supported.
    </li>
    <li>
      An empty expression will always evaluate to <i>true</i>, matching all
      agents.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Examples</h3>
  <dl>
    <dt><tt>master</tt></dt>
    <dd>This block may be executed only on the Jenkins master<dd>

    <dt><tt>linux-machine-42</tt></dt>
    <dd>
      This block may be executed only on the agent with the name
      <tt>linux-machine-42</tt> (or on any machine that happens to have a label
      called <tt>linux-machine-42</tt>)
    </dd>

    <dt><tt>windows &amp;&amp; jdk9</tt></dt>
    <dd>
      This block may be executed only on any Windows agent that has
      version 9 of the Java Development Kit installed (assuming that agents
      with JDK 9 installed have been given a <tt>jdk9</tt> label)
    </dd>

    <dt><tt>postgres &amp;&amp; !vm &amp;&amp; (linux || freebsd)</tt></dt>
    <dd>
      This block may be executed only any on Linux or FreeBSD agent,
      so long as they are <i>not</i> a virtual machine, and they have PostgreSQL
      installed (assuming that each agent has the appropriate labels — in
      particular, each agent running in a virtual machine must have the
      <tt>vm</tt> label in order for this example to work as expected)
    </dd>

  </dl>
