<div>
    Detects that a <code>node</code> block, or certain steps inside it such as <code>sh</code>,
    failed for reasons which are likely due to infrastructure rather than the behavior of the build.
    If the connection to an agent is broken or the agent is removed from the list of executors while in use
    (typically in response to the disappearance of underlying cloud resources),
    this condition will allow <code>retry</code> to allocate a fresh agent and try the whole block again.
